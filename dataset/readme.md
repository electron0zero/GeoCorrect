# About Dataset

### :link: [NYC and Tokyo Check-in Dataset](https://sites.google.com/site/yangdingqi/home/foursquare-dataset)

This dataset contains check-ins in NYC and Tokyo collected for about 10 month (from 12 April 2012 to 16 February 2013).
It contains 227,428 check-ins in New York city and 573,703 check-ins in Tokyo. Each check-in is associated with its time stamp,
its GPS coordinates and its semantic meaning (represented by fine-grained venue-categories).
This dataset is originally used for studying the spatial-temporal regularity of user activity in LBSNs.
